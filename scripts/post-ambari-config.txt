Ambari Setup (steps required after deployment)
==============================================

Ambari Dashboard 
================
# Increase ResourceManager heap size to 3 MB (if any alerts exist)

Master Machine
==============
# Retrieve Mysql temporary password
sudo grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log

# Login to Mysql using the password retrieved above and enter the following commands (these commands are based on the assumption of Hive database being Mysql in master node)
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'NEW-MYSQL-ROOT-PASSWORD-HERE';

CREATE USER 'hive'@'MYSQL-MACHINE-HOSTNAME-HERE' IDENTIFIED BY 'HIVE-PASSWORD-HERE';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'hive'@'MYSQL-MACHINE-HOSTNAME-HERE' WITH GRANT OPTION;
CREATE USER 'hive'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'HIVE-PASSWORD-HERE';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'hive'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


Slave Machines
==============
# If there is a 'hadoop' directory under /usr/hdp in slave nodes, remove them.
rm -fr /usr/hdp/hadoop/

Flume Machines
==============
# One possible error handling in case of existing alerts after setting up Flume:
mkdir /var/run/flume
chown flume:hadoop /var/run/flume
